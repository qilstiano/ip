# AI References - Einstein Chatbot

This document outlines how AI was utilized in the development of the Einstein chatbot project.

For brevity, AI refers to online LLMs such as Deepseek, ChatGPT and Perplexity. 

## AI-Assisted Contributions

AI tools were used selectively to enhance productivity and streamline development while ensuring human oversight and refinement. The specific areas where AI provided assistance include:

### 1. Documentation Generation
- AI was used to generate Javadoc comments for certain methods.
- The generated documentation was reviewed and edited for accuracy and clarity.

### 2. README Formatting
- AI assisted in formatting the `README.md` file for better readability and structure.
- The content itself was written and curated manually, with AI helping to refine markdown styling.

### 3. Debugging Assistance (Last Resort)
- AI was consulted as a debugging companion only after other troubleshooting methods were exhausted.
- Solutions suggested by AI were analyzed before implementation to ensure correctness and security.

### 4. Assertion Writing
- AI was used to generate assertions for test cases.
- Relevant assertions were reviewed, edited, and slotted into the codebase accordingly.

## Human Oversight and Finalization
While AI provided assistance in the areas mentioned above, all outputs were critically reviewed, modified where necessary, and integrated manually to ensure the quality and correctness of the final implementation.
